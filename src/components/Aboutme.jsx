          Throughout my time at Western University, I have developed multiple software projects 
          using Python, Java, C, C++, JavaScript, and SQL, applying core principles of algorithms, 
          data structures, and object-oriented programming. As part of a semester-long group project, 
          I contributed to the development of a machine learning model for breast cancer diagnosis using 
          Sklearn, NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, SciPy, MatPlotLib and Jupyter Notebook, analyzing diagnostic 
          data to optimize model performance. In another team-based project, I collaborated on an interactive
           Java-based math game, where I helped design UI components and implement game logic to enhance user 
           engagement. My coursework also included hands-on experience with database management, where I created, 
           managed, and queried relational databases using SQL and MS Access, reinforcing my understanding of 
           data modeling and query optimization.

          Additionally, I have built front-end web applications that emphasize modern design, responsiveness, and
           user interaction. In Winter 2024, I developed Kit Collective, a fully functional e-commerce website, 
           using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and Bootstrap, incorporating parallax scrolling, Scrollfire animations, 
           and a validated contact form to enhance functionality. Alongside this, I created my personal portfolio website, 
           focusing on a clean, intuitive design that effectively showcases my work. Using CSS Grid and Flexbox, I ensured 
           a fully responsive layout that adapts seamlessly across devices. Both projects highlight my ability to independently 
           design, develop, and optimize front-end web applications, demonstrating my proficiency in web development and 
           user-centered design.

          Though it began as a fun hobby, I have been crocheting for more than
          four years now and have created over 40 unique pieces. I enjoy working
          on practical, fashionable and cozy pieces like tote bags, dresses, and
          sweaters!
