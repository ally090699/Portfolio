        <p className="textcontent">
        My foundation in software development is rooted in a robust academic experience at Western University, where I merged Computer Science and Medical Science studies. This interdisciplinary approach has equipped me with a versatile skillset, enabling me to tackle complex problems using a wide range of programming languages, including Python, Java, C, C++, R, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p className="textcontent">
        In a collaborative project, I led data preprocessing and contributed to data analysis for a breast cancer diagnostic model, leveraging tools like Sklearn, Matplotlib, Numpy and Pandas. Achieving 95% accuracy and 100% recall in early detection showcased my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights, a skill I apply to all my projects.
        </p>
        <p className="textcontent">
        My experience extends to full-stack development, notably with a Java-based math game. Here, I spearheaded front-end development and contributed to the game's logic, ensuring a user-friendly and engaging experience. This project reinforced my understanding of the software development lifecycle, utilizing tools like Jira and GitHub for efficient collaboration.
        </p>
        <p className="textcontent">
        Web development is a core strength, evolving from front-end projects like 'Kit Collective' to full-stack applications using React.js, Next.js, Node.js, MySQL and PostgreSQL. My design skills, honed through projects and graphic design work with the Rare Disease Review Journal, allow me to create visually compelling and intuitive user interfaces. I also understand the importance of accessibility, and have experience with AODA compliance.
